# 7-1_FinalProject

The main design skills that complemented this project were texturing and lighting. The combination of smart texturing and lighting transformed this scene to highlight the best parts of the selected objects. The design process consisted on replicating each of the objects from the 
picture, applying acceptable shaders, implementing proper lighting and shading, and cleanup. These tactics could be applied to any project in the future, as some of these are basic design processes that can be manipulated to fit any basic design project.

Some new strategies that I learned for this 3D scene is to re-size or switch creative directions. In my case, the original 2D picture consisted of four medium-sized books at the center of the scene. For the benefit of the scene, I decided to create only two full-sized 3D books
so that the scene could appear uniform. The only iteration I've experienced came when I found multiplicity on the objects, but ultimately, there were different tactics used for every object. My approach to coding has changed/evolved in a sense where it feels like I'm writing 
less code to complete the program. This is common among more complex programs since some developers opt for a cohesive and clean code, with a working program, as simple as possible.

Thanks to computational graphics and visualization, I have an extensive knowledge on the creative decisions and skills that I can apply to future projects. Since the skills, strategies and knowledge learned in this course can be manipulated to fit other areas and other projects,
they can be used to evolve my coding, design and overall development, thus benefitting my educational and professional future.
